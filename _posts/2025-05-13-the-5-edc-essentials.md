So, what are the 5 EDC essentials?

For me, they are the things you can't leave the house without. Doesn't matter if you are going on a 10 minute grocery run or a 10 day road trip, these things should be right there by your side for whatever life throws at you. However let me clarify that these things don't include the _even more_ basic things that you need for daily life whether you like it or not which are: phone, wallet, and keys.

The 5 EDC essentials are an extension of those 3 basic things and they will help you on those random days when the unexpected happens (I'm talking more "your phone ran out of battery and you need to search for something in the dark" instead of "zombie apocalypse") and they are comprised of:
- Watch
- Flashlight
- Lighter
- Knife or multitool
- Pen & paper

So lets go one by one to see the logic behind them.

# Watch
I know, I know, why do I need a watch if my phone already tells time? Well a watch is a way better version of your phone for telling time but it is also so much more than that. A watch tells you the time instantly by just looking at your wrist without the need to pull out your phone, turning on the screen and getting distracted by a ton of notifications. 

Don't tell me you haven't taken out your phone to check something and ended up doing something completely different only to remember once you've put it away that you didn't even do the thing why you took it out of your pocket in the first place.

Also a watch, as I mentioned, is so much more than a time piece. It can be a fashion statement, a conversation starter, a family heirloom, a unique gadget, a reminder, and so much more. There are thousands of watch brands, each with their individual style so there are tons of options for you to choose something that matches your vibe. And that is without mentioning other characteristics like the different watch types: mechanic, quartz, solar, etc.

I'm a fan of the Seiko brand with their amazing Japanese quality for affordable prices and the watch I'm currently wearing is the Seiko SPB253, which is a remaster of an old 1965 watch: the first dive watch by Seiko called 62MAS which was issued to the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition.

# Flashlight
Flashlights by themselves are an entire world. You can go to places like the flashlight's subreddit and you are going to be overwhelmed by the amount of different flashlights you can find. However, carrying one should be an essential part of your EDC. And I know, just like with the watch there are people who are going to ask: Why do I need a flashlight if my phone already has one?

Well, for starters, as a backup. Smartphones generally get drained during the day and by the time it's night you might be running low on battery, so when darkness falls and you need your flashlight, you won't have it. 

Also, smartphone flashlights suck. You might be able to shine a light less than a meter away (or 8.74 hamburgers for my USA friends) but there are times when you need to light something further away than that and you'll be happy to have a flashlight with you. 

Same as watches, there are tons of models with different features so the one you choose might depend on your needs. For example if you bike a lot you might want one that has a red light feature so you can clip it to your back so cars can see you in the dark. Or if you live in a zone where there are lots of scorpions, you might want one with UV light so you can spot them at night.
