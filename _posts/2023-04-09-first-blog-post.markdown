Hello everyone!

This is my first blog post, I just finished setting up Jekyll and wanted to create a simple test post to check if everything is working properly.

The journey so far has been setting up:
1. Github Pages
2. Custom Domain
3. Jekyll Installation
4. Minimal Mistakes Theme
5. Configuration files and defaults
6. Landing, Blog and About pages creation

The roadmap for future development involves improving SEO and adding analytics to my site. But first I'll start publishing posts so I can get the feel of what I need and what I don't, otherwise I'll stay on an endless loop of tweaking and optimizing. 

So, thank you for joining me on this journey and I hope I've inspired you to dedicate some time to work on your own projects.
