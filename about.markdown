Hey, I'm Athemis! An aerospace engineer with a polymath heart. This webpage is a place for me to write about my interests and is basically a repository of my projects.

There is no AI involved in writing any of my posts as there is already enough of that stuff all over the internet, here you'll only find human made things so if you're into that sort of thing then I hope you find something that sparks your curiosity and we can connect over.
